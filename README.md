# -100daysofcode-mobile_app-
Hello! Iâ€™m Rakibul Islam.

Mobile application development is not new for me. I worked on both native and flutter Android apps. I am a mid-level developer in flutter and native. Familiar with firebase and SQLite as well. But I'd like to go over everything again, and this time it will be a full-stack plan. I'd like to learn a backend framework.  So starting the journey #100daysofcode . The initial plan is to start with native, then some application with firebase and SQLite. Then move on to flutter and finally a backend framework. I won't devote too much attention to native and flutter; instead, I'll concentrate on the backend framework.

Writing here after a huge break. I was affected by dengue fever and my health condition was not good. After a little bit recovery I travled to my home for full rest. So I decided now to not continue like 100days challenge. I will do it like regular practice.
