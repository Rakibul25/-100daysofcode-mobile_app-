# -100daysofcode-mobile_app-
Hello! Iâ€™m Rakibul Islam.
Mobile application development is not new for me. I worked on android native and flutter. I am a mid-level developer in flutter and native. Familiar with firebase and sqflite as well. But I want to recap the whole thing and want to learn a backend framework this time.  So starting the journey #100daysofcode . The initial plan is to start with native, then some application with firebase and sqflite. Then flutter and finally a backend framework. I will not spend too much time on native and flutter, the main focus is the backend framework.
